# Endpoints

You may find the OpenAPI docs [here](https://underwriting-api.joinarlo.com/docs#/) and the raw JSON specification [here](https://underwriting-api.joinarlo.com/openapi.json). The base API URL is `https://underwriting-api.joinarlo.com/cpq`.

*The OpenAPI documentation provides comprehensive details for each endpoint, including response types and sample responses. This resource helps streamline your development process while reducing the need for numerous test API requests to our testing environment.*

## Plans

A plan is defined by a unique combination of network, PBM, vendor stack, and benefit details (including accumulators and cost shares by benefit category). You can retrieve detailed breakdowns of all plans offered by Arlo through these endpoints. The responses provide comprehensive benefits information, including accumulators, cost share data by benefit category, and other plan specifications.

### Get all plans

[Endpoint Documentation](https://underwriting-api.joinarlo.com/docs#/Plans/route_handler_cpq_plans_get)

This endpoint returns all available plans that can be quoted and their detailed information.

<CodeGroup>
```sh Request
curl --request GET \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>" \
  --header "Arlo-API-Version: 2025-04-01" \
  --url https://underwriting-api.joinarlo.com/cpq/plans
```
</CodeGroup>

### Get a specific plan

[Endpoint Documentation](https://underwriting-api.joinarlo.com/docs#/Plan/route_handler_cpq_plan__plan_design_id__get)

This endpoint returns the detailed information of a specific plan. The `plan_id` can be retrieved from the bulk `/plans` endpoint.

<CodeGroup>
```sh Request
curl --request GET \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>" \
  --header "Arlo-API-Version: 2025-04-01" \
  --url https://underwriting-api.joinarlo.com/cpq/plan/<plan_id>
```
</CodeGroup>


## Proposals

To obtain quotes from Arlo, create a proposal for each new opportunity. A proposal represents a unique pairing of quoting broker and group. Note that any modification to group information—including name, effective date, headquarters state, or census data—requires creating a new proposal.

### Submit proposal information

[Endpoint Documentation](https://underwriting-api.joinarlo.com/docs#/Proposal/route_handler_cpq_proposal_post)

<CodeGroup>
```sh Request
curl --request POST \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>" \
  --header "Arlo-API-Version: 2025-04-01" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --url https://underwriting-api.joinarlo.com/cpq/proposal \
  --data '{
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2"
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

This endpoint creates a new proposal.

In order to create a proposal, you must provide details about the group, all the individuals to be covered by the plan (including dependents), and all information about the quoting broker.

You may specify particular `plan_ids` you wish to be quoted. Note that Arlo groups plans internally by “program”, so even when requesting a single `plan_id`, the response may include all plans associated with that program. You can disregard any additional plans not relevant to your needs.

Proposal creation is “asynchronous”. In other words, you will receive a `proposal_id` in the response.


#### Requesting broker and agency information
The request body must include complete broker and agency information:

**Required Broker Details:**

- Broker name
- Broker email
- Broker NPN (National Producer Number)

**Agency Details:**

- Agency name
- Agency NPN

This information is essential for proper proposal attribution and compliance requirements.
Note: If a broker operates independently (not affiliated with an agency), you may set agency_name and agency_npn to null. However, all broker fields remain mandatory.


### Retrieve proposal quotes

[Endpoint Documentation](https://underwriting-api.joinarlo.com/docs#/Proposal/route_handler_cpq_proposal__proposal_id__get)

<CodeGroup>
```sh Request
curl --request GET \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>" \
  --header "Arlo-API-Version: 2025-04-01" \
  --url https://underwriting-api.joinarlo.com/cpq/proposal/<proposal_id>
```
</CodeGroup>

After creating a proposal, you can poll this endpoint to retrieve the quoted information. The response provides comprehensive details about the proposal request and the quoted rates for all requested plan designs.

After creating a proposal, you can poll this endpoint to check its status. **To prevent server overload, please limit polling frequency to once every 10-15 seconds.**
- Fully underwritten quotes are typically available within 45 seconds.
- Illustrative quotes are typically available within 10 seconds.

See the [Fully Underwritten vs Illustrative Rates](#fully-underwritten-vs-illustrative-rates) section for more details.


### Mark a proposal sold

[Endpoint Documentation](https://underwriting-api.joinarlo.com/docs#/Proposal/route_handler_cpq_proposal__proposal_id__mark_sold_post)

<CodeGroup>
```sh Request
curl --request POST \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>" \
  --header "Arlo-API-Version: 2025-04-01" \
  --url https://underwriting-api.joinarlo.com/cpq/proposal/<proposal_id>/mark-sold
```
</CodeGroup>

When a quoting broker decides to proceed with an Arlo plan, you can mark the proposal as sold. This requires only the proposal ID—no need to specify individual plans.

Upon successful completion, the response will include a `url` and `message`:

1. Display the `message` to the broker after they've marked the group as sold
2. Redirect the broker to the provided `url`

The broker will experience one of two flows:

1. Brokers who have never sold with Arlo before: Redirected to a calendar scheduling page where our sales team will promptly arrange a meeting to explain the implementation process
2. Returning brokers: Directly routed to the Arlo quoting portal where they can navigate the implementation process independently

# The Proposal Object
A single proposal can include quotes for multiple plans. Each plan quote provides not only rates but also detailed information about the funding structure, contract length, quote assessment type, and more.

## Fully Underwritten vs Illustrative Rates
Each plan quote includes a `quote_assessment_type` field, which will be either `FULLY_UNDERWRITTEN` or `ILLUSTRATIVE`.

- `FULLY_UNDERWRITTEN`: Rates are generated through a comprehensive medical underwriting process.
- `ILLUSTRATIVE`: Rates are based on a simplified assessment using only the group’s demographic information.

It's important for CPQ API consumers to identify the `quote_assessment_type` for each plan quote and ensure the appropriate context is communicated to the broker.


# Authentication

You will receive your testing API key separately in the format `arlo_test_*`. Production API keys follow the format `arlo_live_*`.

# API Versioning

The CPQ API implements versioning through the `Arlo-API-Version` header. The current version is `2025-04-01`. New API versions will be released only when introducing breaking changes.


Note: You can use the production URL for testing by simply using your test API key instead of your live key.

# Testing

By default, the `/proposal` endpoints return mock responses to simplify testing. Mock mode is automatically enabled when using test API keys.

**Mock mode behavior:**
- Request parameters are validated normally
- No actual quoting or processing is performed
- Mock rates and information are returned
- Response structure is identical to production responses

**To disable mock mode:**
Set the `arlo-mock-response` header to `false` for full integration testing. We recommend using this option sparingly and only as a final verification step before production, to minimize unnecessary load on the sandbox environment.

```sh Request
# Explicitly set the mock response to true
curl --request GET \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>" \
  --header "Arlo-API-Version: 2025-04-01" \
  --header "Arlo-Mock-Response: true" \
  --url https://underwriting-api.joinarlo.com/cpq/proposal/<proposal_id>

# Explicitly set the mock response to false
curl --request GET \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>" \
  --header "Arlo-API-Version: 2025-04-01" \
  --header "Arlo-Mock-Response: false" \
  --url https://underwriting-api.joinarlo.com/cpq/proposal/<proposal_id>
```

# Request IDs

All requests to the CPQ API will return a `x-request_id` in the response headers. This ID can be used to correlate requests with responses and for debugging purposes. We recommend
logging these IDs if you ever need to reach out to us about an issue.

```sh Response
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
x-request-id: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
```
