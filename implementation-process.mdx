## Implementation Timeline
We require the following documentation in order to bind a group's policy. 

<Warning>
  <b>Timely submission of the final enrollment and the medical disclosure</b>
  
  Our rates are subject to change until the final enrollment and medical disclosures are verified. To avoid any last-minute surprises, it’s crucial that we receive this information at least 14 days prior to the effective date.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="14 days prior to the effective date">
    * Final enrollment census 
    * Signed medical disclosure questionnaire 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Within 31 days of effective date">
    * Signed stop loss proposal 
    * Signed stop loss application
    * Binder premium payment with remittance report (remitted by TPA outside of the Arlo portal) 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Within 60 days of effective date">
    * Signed summary plan document (SPD) 
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Staying on Top of Implementation
The quoting portal simplifies managing a group’s implementation. Once you mark the group as "sold," you’ll have access to the implementation page, which features a live checklist for all required items.

<Tip>
  As you submit signed documents and they are approved by the Arlo team, the checklist will automatically update, giving you real-time status updates for effortless tracking.
</Tip>

### Final Enrollment
As mentioned above, it is recommended to submit the final enrollment as soon as possible to lock in your rates. You can submit the final enrollment census directly via the implementation checklist in our portal.


### Stop Loss Proposal and Application
You can submit both signed documents through the quoting portal, and for added convenience, you may choose to submit them together to streamline the process with your client.

* The original, unsigned proposal is available for download from the group’s page in the quoting portal at any time.
* However, you must complete the following implementation steps before you can download the application:
  * Submit the signed Medical Disclosure (via the quoting portal)
  * Submit the final enrollment census (via the quoting portal)
  * Select the chosen plan designs (via the quoting portal)
  * Remit the Binder Premium (typically completed by the TPA)


### Remitting the Binder Premium 
Typically, the TPA remits all premium payments to Arlo and submits a remittance report. For a copy of Arlo’s premium payment instructions, please reach out to us via email or chat. 


### Signed Summary Plan Document (SPD)
The SPD is the only required document that Arlo does not produce. Typically, the TPA or health plan issues the SPD for signature. Upload the signed copy to us in the portal by clicking “Sign and Submit the SPD” on the Implementation Checklist. 


## Rerates
Our initial proposal is contingent on the group’s final enrollment. As long as the final enrollment matches the quoted figures, the rate will remain unchanged.

However, we understand that final enrollment may differ from the initial quote, and we aim to maintain our rates unless there is a significant change in risk.

To avoid the need for a rerate, we recommend submitting the final enrollment through the quoting dashboard as early and as frequently as possible.

If a rerate becomes necessary, watch this short video to learn how to manage the rerate process through the portal.
