## The implementation timeline
We require the following documentation in order to bind a group's policy. 

<Warning>
  <b>Timely submission of the final enrollment and the medical disclosure</b>
  
  Our rates are subject to change until the final enrollment and medical disclosures are verified. To avoid any last-minute surprises, it’s crucial that we receive this information at least 14 days prior to the effective date.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="14 days prior to the effective date">
    * Final enrollment census 
    * Signed medical disclosure questionnaire 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Within 31 days of effective date">
    * Signed stop loss proposal 
    * Signed stop loss application
    * Binder premium payment with remittance report (remitted by TPA outside of the Arlo portal) 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Within 60 days of effective date">
    * Signed summary plan document (SPD) 
  </Step>
</Steps>


## The Implementation Checklist on the Quoting Portal
The group’s implementation page will load after a group is marked as “sold” in the portal. You will see a checklist for all of the above-listed items. As each signed document is submitted and ultimately approved by the Arlo team, the document statuses will automatically update on the implementation checklist for your reference. 

Type whatever you want.
