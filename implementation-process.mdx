## The implementation timeline
We require the following documentation in order to bind a group's policy. 

<Warning>
  <b>Submitting the Final Enrollment and the Medical Disclosure Questionnaire on time is critical in order to avoid last-minute re-rates.</b>
</Warning>

1. No later than 7 days prior to effective date:  
    * Final enrollment census 
    * Signed medical disclosure questionnaire 
2. By the effective date: 
    * Binder premium payment with remittance report (remitted by TPA outside of the Arlo portal) 
3. Within 30 days of effective date: 
    * Signed stop loss proposal 
    * Signed stop loss application 
4. Within 45 days of effective date: 
    * Signed summary plan document (SPD)

## The Implementation Checklist on the Quoting Portal
The group’s implementation page will load after a group is marked as “sold” in the portal. You will see a checklist for all of the above-listed items. As each signed document is submitted and ultimately approved by the Arlo team, the document statuses will automatically update on the implementation checklist for your reference. 

Type whatever you want.
