title: 'Underwriting Guidelines'
description: 'Get acquainted with our guidelines before you start quoting'
---

## The basics

1. We quote groups between 5 - 125 _enrolled_ employees only
2. We require a minimum participation of 50% (or 75% after eligible waivers)
3. We require a member-level census (i.e., name, DOB, gender, and zipcodes of dependents as well)
4. We don't require IHQs but like to see claims experience if the group has any
5. We don't cover 1099s, retirees, or part-time workers

[Contact our team](mailto:quotes@joinarlo.com) for a full list of our underwriting guidelines.


## State-Level Restrictions
While our underwriting guidelines don't vary too much, there are some slight restrictions by state. See the table below for our state-level restrictions.

**Note:** We do not quote businesses based in WA, CA, DC, and NY.
