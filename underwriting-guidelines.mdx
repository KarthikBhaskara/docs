## The basics

A high-level overview of our guidelines are as follows:
1. We quote groups between 5 - 125 _enrolled_ employees only
2. We require a minimum participation of 50% (or 75% after eligible waivers)
3. We require a member-level census (i.e., name, DOB, gender, and zipcodes of dependents as well)
4. We don't require IHQs but like to see claims experience if the group has any
5. We don't cover 1099s, retirees, or part-time workers


## State-Level Restrictions
While our underwriting guidelines don't vary too much, there are some slight restrictions by state. [Contact our team](mailto:quotes@joinarlo.com) for a full state-level breakdown.
