## Navigating the Portal
Once you have submitted a quote opportunity, the portal will continue to serve as your source of truth allowing you to review and download proposals, download and submit signed documents during implementation, and more.

## Troubleshooting

Here's how to solve some common problems when using the portal.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I can't see any submissions">
    This is most likely because you are a new user that has not been granted access to your existing organization yet. Please send an email to [quotes@joinarlo.com](mailto:quotes@joinarlo.com) to request access.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The census file importer is not allowing me to submit my census">
    Our census file importer tries to make things as easy as possible for you. However, some files are too large, have too many empty rows, have broken formulas, or some other issue.
    
    In those cases, we recommend copying the key cells and creating a new, fresh Excel (or csv) file. Then restart the file submission process with the new file.

    If errors persist, please send an email to [quotes@joinarlo.com](mailto:quotes@joinarlo.com).
