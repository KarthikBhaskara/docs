## Navigating the Portal
Once you have submitted your groups through the portal, the Submissions page will serve as your source of truth for all of your submissions. You can review proposals, download official documents, submit signed documents during implementation, and more.

## Marking a Group as Sold
Once your customer has approved the quoted rates, mark the group as Sold in the portal. This will automatically move the group from the “Quoting” status to “Implementation,” and you can begin submitting the required documentation on the group’s behalf.
