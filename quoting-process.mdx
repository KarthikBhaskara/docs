## Submitting a Census File
Standardizing census files can be a nightmare. However, our file importer lets you submit a census file in any format and guides you through the process of cleaning it up. Watch the following video for a short walkthough.


## Reviewing Your Proposal
Once you have submitted your quote opportunity through the portal, we will return our quote within 24 hours. You can use the portal to review the rates, download a proposal pdf, and more.



## Troubleshooting

Here's how to solve some common problems when using the portal.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I can't see any submissions">
    This is most likely because you are a new user that has not been granted access to your existing organization yet. Please send an email to [quotes@joinarlo.com](mailto:quotes@joinarlo.com) to request access.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The census file importer is not allowing me to submit my census">
    Our census file importer tries to make things as easy as possible for you. However, some files are too large, have too many empty rows, have broken formulas, or some other issue.
    
    In those cases, we recommend copying the key cells and creating a new, fresh Excel (or csv) file. Then restart the file submission process with the new file.

    If errors persist, please send an email to [quotes@joinarlo.com](mailto:quotes@joinarlo.com).
