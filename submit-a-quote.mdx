## Reviewing Your Proposal
Once you have submitted your quote opportunity through the portal, we will return a proposal within 24 hours.

You can review our quotes, download proposals in PDF and Excel formats, and do much more - all right within the quoting portal. Watch our short tutorial video to learn how you do this in under a minute.


## Marking a Group as Sold
When your group has agreed to move forward with Arlo's quote, you can mark the submission as "Sold" in the quoting portal. This will kickoff the implementation process ensuring we can bind the policy in a timely manner.


## Troubleshooting

Here's how to solve some common problems when using the portal.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I can't see any submissions">
    This is most likely because you are a new user that has not been granted access to your existing organization yet. Please send an email to [quotes@joinarlo.com](mailto:quotes@joinarlo.com) to request access.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The census file importer is not allowing me to submit my census">
    Our census file importer tries to make things as easy as possible for you. However, some files are too large, have too many empty rows, have broken formulas, or some other issue.
    
    In those cases, we recommend copying the key cells and creating a new, fresh Excel (or csv) file. Then restart the file submission process with the new file.

    If errors persist, please send an email to [quotes@joinarlo.com](mailto:quotes@joinarlo.com).
