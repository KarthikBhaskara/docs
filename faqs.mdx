## Quoting and Rates
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are the minimum state requirements? Is it eligible or enrolled?">
    * We quote groups between 5 - 125 enrolled employees only.
    * For a list of state-by-state requirements, please refer to our [Underwriting Guidelines](/underwriting-guidelines) page.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Which states do you quote in?">
    We quote in all states with the exception of Oklahoma, New York, and Washington. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can you laser a person?">
    Not directly. However, we can quote a group assuming a certain person is not covered under the stop-loss policy. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Your rates are uncompetitive / you declined all my groups / your rates are too competitive?">
    Our rates have a wide range - to best understand how to work with us, we recommend to submit at least 10 groups. On average we decline 30% of cases and see that we are competitive 30-40% of the time. However, it highly depends on the type of groups we see. If 5 other carriers have declined the risk, we most likely will too. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why was my group DTQ’d? Can you share more details on what conditions triggered this?">
    Unfortunately, we cannot share the specific details around why a group is declined. That said, we only decline for these very high risk conditions:
    * Multiple Sclerosis
    * Metastatic Cancer
    * Stem Cell/ Bone Marrow Transplants
    * End Stage Renal Disease/ Kidney Failure
    * Organ Transplants & complications
    * Hemophilia
    * Cystic Fibrosis
    * Other similar high cost conditions

  <b>We are working on making this more explicit!</b>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="My group was declined to quote due to lack of data. What does ‘Lack of Data’ mean?">
    There are a few steps you can take to ensure your group is quoted successfully:
    Check the census file for correctness:
    * Make sure dependents are included
    * Common mistakes are: 
      * First Name & Last Name Columns are swapped 
      * Genders are mixed up 
      * DOB Month and Day are swapped for some records
      * First Name is ‘employee’ or ‘child’ which are not valid first names
    
    If you’ve reviewed your census and all looks good, there may be other factors at play. We may not receive enough data for groups that are on Kaiser, in particular geographies, or with Sedera / a Health Share where no claims are produced.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I have claims experience - what should I do with it? ">
    Please submit it as additional documentation when submitting the [quote](https://quotes.joinarlo.com/dashboard/new).

## Quoting and Rates
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="The group’s census changed. How do I update the census file?">
    If the group is still quoting, you can update the census by following the steps outlined in [this short video](https://www.loom.com/share/e5a6234041b749da968b35617b3a57fb?sid=c4e628e0-834f-44d3-9b49-1b6ece05902d).

    If the group is in implementation, please submit a new final enrollment census. Visit our [implementation resource page](/implementation) for a guide. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I change a group’s effective date?">
    Changing the effective date is simple while the group is in the quoting process. Watch [this short video](https://www.loom.com/share/cdb695cba4104ffc892b8dfb596b5ad7?sid=9598f82a-fcaa-4491-9320-fc7e2115c1a3) to see how.

    If the group’s effective date changes during implementation, please reach out to us at quotes@joinarlo.com.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When are rates considered firm?">
    * We can only issue firm quotes 90 days prior to the group’s effective date. Prior to that timeframe, quotes are speculative only. 
    * Quotes are firm in relation to census 
    * Rates are considered final after we receive the final enrollment census and the completed medical disclosure questionnaire during the implementation process. Please note that while we do our best to avoid rerates, a group may be subject to a rerate if enrollment changes at any time throughout implementation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I know when Arlo has received a group’s binder premium payment?">
    This will be reflected directly in the quoting portal. Once a group’s binder premium payment is received and processed, the status of this task will go from “pending” to “complete” on the group’s implementation page.
